		<p id='dtrws'><b>Dover and Thanet Rights of Way Society</b></p>
		<p>The Society was founded in 1974 to walk and protect the footpaths of East Kent, and we still regularly clear overgrown paths in the area.<br />We walk every other Sunday morning with a 10.30 start (10 o'clock in summertime), and normally cover 5 or 6 miles in 2 to 2 1/2 hours. These walks are either in or very close to the Dover and Thanet District areas, and are well supported. We also arrange whole day walks a little further afield on one Saturday each month. All start at 10 a.m., and are 10 to 14 miles long with a pub lunch en route. Evening social events are also organised during the year.<br />New members (and visitors to the area) are always welcome. The annual subscription is &pound;5 per family, and includes two copies of "Waymarker" magazine, produced by our members.<br/>More Information - Contact Kate Taylor on 01304 822816 or Roger King at <a href="mailto:roger@rambler89.wanadoo.co.uk">roger@rambler89.wanadoo.co.uk</a></p>
